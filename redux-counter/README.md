REDUX NOTES:

- EVENTS (user interactions, usually) trigger ACTIONS.

- When those ACTIONS get DISPATCHED they send the data to STORE (with useDispatch)

- The REDUCER uses the data from the ACTION and STATE and actually does the logic to REDUCE it to the new STATE, which it then returns so React can render.
